Some z80 programs that I've made


addmany_arr8_8.s:

Takes two arguments: UBYTE,UBYTE*
where UBYTE is the size of the array
and returns an 8 bit result of the sum of all the elements


addmany_arr16_16.s:
  
Takes two arguments: UBYTE,UINT16*
where UBYTE is the size of the array 
and returns a 16 bit result of the sum of all the elements
